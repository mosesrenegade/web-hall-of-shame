# Passwords Policies that are nightmares

The websites listed in here have issues with Passwords. These websites should change the way they treat passwords. There are probably valid, historical reasons, that the systems here have limitations. In today's age, no they need to change.

## Limited Password Reset Options

- [Venmo](http://www.venmo.com): "Your password must be 8-32 characters long"
- [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com): "Your password must be between 8-20 characters long"
- [American Airlines](http://www.aa.com): "Your password must be between 5-16 characters long" Authors Note: American Airlines will ALLOW you to set a password that is longer in the password reset page. Your password manager will store and attempt to use it in the login page. It will subsequently FAIL because its too long, but you don't realize this until you manually paste it in. It will then TRUNCATE to 16 characters. Terrible design.
